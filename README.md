## Description

A webpage for the 25th annual Science Fair Chili Cook-Off! This event is completely fake, and I only created this project to get some practice using some new technologies:
  * [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
  * [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
  * [Parallax Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfeqDyMUx4)
